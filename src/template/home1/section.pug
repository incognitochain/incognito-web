                    h1.title The easiest way to own crypto
                    .description Plug in, earn crypto. That’s about it. Node helps you collect the Incognito native token (PRV) – and all you need to do is turn it on.

                    .description Want to keep track of your earnings? Do it from the app. Node doesn’t require babysitting (or hours spent staring at order books), so you can earn crypto while you’re chilling at the beach.

                //-     .description If you’ve ever tried to buy a little Bitcoin and ended up backing out, we get it. Typically, it’s not super easy to get your hands on crypto. You’ll have to upload your ID and SSN on shady crypto exchanges, buy directly from strangers or cobble together your own mining rig. It’s not ideal.
                //-     .description With Node, you don’t have to give up your personal info. You don’t need any technical expertise. You literally just need a power socket, and a place for your Node to sit.

                        .description Mining rigs are so yesterday.
                    .description Node earns crypto by powering a new type of protocol (Proof of Stake, for our fellow nerds out there), one that consumes substantially less energy. This means hash rates don’t apply, and you’re not in a duck-swinging battle to see who’s got the biggest, baddest supercomputer.
                    .description Node needs just 1.5kwh a day to run, so if you live in the USA, it will cost you less than 8 cents to keep Node running all day long. Node is the most low maintenance housemate/pet you’ve ever had.

                    .description Do you think people deserve privacy? So does Node.
                    .description Node is a gadget with heart. It earns rewards for powering incognito mode for the crypto world. When you switch Node on, you’re not just earning crypto, you’re also giving anyone the option to claim their right to privacy.
                    .description Node makes sure you’re rewarded for protecting these rights, so a percentage of every private transaction will go you. This means whenever someone sends Bitcoin privately, you get PRV.

                        .description Watch your rewards accumulate in real-time.
                    .description Your Node will work together with thousands of other Nodes to support and sustain a decentralized, alternative network where all transactions are confidential. This means you don’t have to trust institutions, service providers and profit-driven centralized parties to tell you your information is safe. Node makes sure you’re in control.

                    h1.title Hold up. What do you mean confidential transactions?
                    .description Whenever anyone sends or receives crypto - that’s recorded on a public ledger. That means anyone can search your entire crypto financial history, see how much you have, what you do with it, who you send it to, and where it comes from.
                    .description If you think crypto is gonna get bigger, then we have a problem. You don’t need to have anything to hide to not want to expose your bank statements to the entire world.
                    .description Node powers the Incognito Network. Incognito is a privacy-focused alternative, which uses advanced cryptographic techniques (zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures and stealth addresses) to obscure the sender, receiver, and amount of every single transaction made on the network.
                    .description Node makes the application of this technology possible, for anyone who wants to claim their right to privacy. And neither the owner of a Node, or the user of the network, needs any technical expertise to earn rewards or choose privacy. That’s where we come in.

                    .description Node is made of scratch-resistant, anodized aluminum, so if takes a minor tumble, you’ll be ok. It’s lightweight (X lbs), sleek (size), and robust.

                    .description We integrate sustainability into the very core of the product. By powering a PoS protocol instead of the traditional PoW, Node is an energy-efficient alternative to an environmentally wasteful industry.
                    .description Node is predominantly made of aluminum and canvas, both of which are widely recyclable, and constitute easily removable components. The motherboard is lead-free and can be repurposed. Node opts to be powered by external sources and thus does not contain a battery. Node’s packaging is made entirely out of recycled cardboard and paper – no plastic is used.

                    h1.title FAQ
                    h3.subtitle Why is Node so much more efficient than traditional mining devices?
                    .description Traditional mining relies on an energy-guzzling mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). Most major blockchains have now made upgrades to Proof of Stake (PoS) - a much more efficient system. By running only the latest PoS blockchains, Node is able to earn you cryptocurrency for less energy than it takes to power your desktop.
                    h3.subtitle When will Node ship?
                    .description Node will begin shipping in early February 2023 with priority for the first orders.
                    h3.subtitle How much electricity does it consume?
                    .description Node is very energy efficient. At maximum capacity, it consumers ~1.5 kWh a day. On average, it consumes less than ~1 kWh a day. In the US, that’s about $0.08 a day.
                    h3.subtitle What is the return policy?
                        .description An <span>unopened node</span> still in sealed packaging returned within <span>30 days</span> will receive a full refund. The return window begins once the node is delivered successfully.
                    h3.subtitle What is covered in your warranty?
                        .sub-description 1) Download the Incognito Wallet App.
                        .sub-description 2) <span>1,750 PRV</span> is required to start your node. Please buy PRV to complete the setup <a href="https://incognito.org/swap" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    h3.subtitle How to run your node?
                        .sub-description Incognito offers warranty service for all of the nodes.
                        .sub-description Nodes will carry a warranty for 12 months.
                        .sub-description If you need to claim against the warranty, please [contact us](mailto:go@incognito.org) and we'll guide you through the process.
                    h3.subtitle What is the return policy?
                    .description If you don’t love your Node, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked.
                    h3.subtitle Which countries are Node available in?
                    .description Node ships worldwide and ships quickly through our warehouse partners in North America.
                    h3.subtitle How long does it take to set up Node?
                    .description Plug it in. Connect to WiFi. Let it run. That’s it!
                    h3.subtitle How quiet is Node?
                    .description Node is extremely quiet, even when it operates at maximum capacity. You can set up Node anywhere. On the kitchen counter, in your bedroom, or in the office.
                    h3.subtitle Which currencies can Node earn?
                    //.description Node earns Incognito’s native coin, Privacy (PRV), for every block created. Since Node offers incognito mode for multiple currencies from multiple blockchains, it can also collect transaction fees in multiple cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, BNB, and more).
                    .description Node earns Incognito’s native coin, Privacy (PRV), for every block created.
                    h3.subtitle Are my dollar earnings fixed?
                    .description The fiat value of what Node earns is variable, due to the volatility of the crypto market. Users are free at any time to withdraw their rewards and cash out to fiat. Via the Node app, users will be able to see the USD value of their assets at any given time, and be able to make decisions on whether or not they would like to withdraw.
                    h3.subtitle How much will I earn?
                    .description The money Node will make is dependent on how many people use the network to send and receive crypto privately (BTC, ETH, BNB, etc.). While we are hesitant to give exact numbers as there are many variables, we are confident in advertising minimum earnings around the $12/month range (at today's market price). Node earns rewards for powering privacy for the token economy, and as such, its value is tied to the network's usage. Please only purchase Node if you believe what it does is useful or meaningful.
